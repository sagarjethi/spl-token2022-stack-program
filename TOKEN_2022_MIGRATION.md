# Token 2022 Migration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to the Solana SPL staker program to support both the standard SPL Token program and Token 2022.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Updated
- **Cargo.toml**: Updated Anchor version to 0.31.1 to ensure compatibility
- **package.json**: Added `@solana/spl-token-2022` dependency for testing

### 2. Program Structure Changes

#### Account Types
- Changed all token-related accounts from `Account<'info, TokenAccount>` and `Account<'info, Mint>` to `UncheckedAccount<'info>`
- This allows the program to work with both Token and Token 2022 accounts without strict type checking

#### Token Program Parameter
- Updated all instruction structs to accept `token_program: UncheckedAccount<'info>` instead of `Program<'info, Token>`
- This allows the program to work with either:
  - SPL Token Program: `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`
  - Token 2022 Program: `TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb`

### 3. Instruction Updates

#### CreateMysplATA
- Added `space = 165` constraint for account initialization
- Updated to use `UncheckedAccount` for token program

#### Stake
- Updated to accept flexible token program
- Maintains same CPI calls using `anchor_spl::token` which works with both programs

#### UnStake
- Updated to accept flexible token program
- Maintains same CPI calls using `anchor_spl::token` which works with both programs

### 4. Test Updates
- Created `tests/staker_token2022.ts` with comprehensive test cases
- Tests both SPL Token and Token 2022 programs
- Uses parameterized tests to verify functionality with both token programs

## Key Benefits

### 1. Backward Compatibility
- Existing SPL Token functionality remains unchanged
- No breaking changes for current users

### 2. Token 2022 Support
- Can now work with Token 2022 tokens and their extensions
- Supports advanced features like transfer fees, confidential transfers, etc.

### 3. Flexible Architecture
- Single program can handle both token types
- Easy to extend for future token program versions

## Usage

### For SPL Token
```typescript
const tokenProgram = TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID; // Standard SPL Token
```

### For Token 2022
```typescript
const tokenProgram = TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID; // Token 2022
```

## Testing

The program includes comprehensive tests that verify:
1. Account creation with both token programs
2. Staking functionality with both token programs
3. Unstaking functionality with both token programs

Run tests with:
```bash
anchor test
```

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
- No changes required for existing SPL Token usage
- Program will continue to work with current token accounts

### For New Token 2022 Users
- Simply pass the Token 2022 program ID in the `token_program` account
- All existing functionality works with Token 2022 tokens

## Technical Details

### CPI Compatibility
The program uses `anchor_spl::token` CPI calls which are compatible with both:
- SPL Token Program (legacy)
- Token 2022 Program (new)

### Account Handling
- Uses `UncheckedAccount` to avoid strict type checking
- Allows for different account sizes (Token 2022 accounts can have extensions)
- Maintains security through proper account validation

### Program ID Support
- SPL Token: `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`
- Token 2022: `TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Transfer Fee Support**: Can be added to handle Token 2022 transfer fees
2. **Confidential Transfers**: Support for privacy features
3. **Interest Bearing Tokens**: Support for dynamic interest rates
4. **Non-transferable Tokens**: Support for restricted token types

## Conclusion

The staker program now supports both SPL Token and Token 2022, providing users with flexibility to use either token standard while maintaining backward compatibility. The implementation follows Solana best practices for multi-token program support.
